{"name":"CheckIn","tagline":"CheckIn Attendance. Never count heads again.","body":"### Welcome to the future.\r\nWe've all been there. Waiting in silence for that substitute teacher to call our name, praying that they'll say it right. On the other side of the desk, teachers waste approximately 45 seconds per class, or 30 minutes every week, counting the heads in the chairs in their classroom.\r\n\r\n### CheckIn is here to change that.\r\nImagine if you never had to deal with attendance ever again. Your students simply need to wave their ID at the box on their way into the room. You, and your principal, can view and analyse data in CheckIn's beautiful web UI. Or, the data can be seamlessly exported to a third party classroom management suite like eSchool or Infinite Campus.\r\n\r\n### Ready to give it a shot?\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/JackDoan/CheckIn.git\r\n# pip install < requirements.txt\r\n$ ./checkin.py &\r\n$ ./web/http.py &\r\n```\r\n[Go ahead, try it.](http://admin:secret@localhost:5000/data)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
